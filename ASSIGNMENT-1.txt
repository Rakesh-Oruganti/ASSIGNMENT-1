2)DIFFERIENTIATE BETWEEN SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNING.
ANS:   Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two main categories of machine learning algorithms, distinguished by the presence or absence of labeled training data and the objectives of the learning process.

    Supervised Learning:
        In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, where each input data point is associated with a corresponding output label.
        The objective is to learn a mapping function from input variables to output variables based on example input-output pairs.
        The algorithm aims to generalize from the labeled training data to make predictions or decisions about unseen data.
        Common tasks in supervised learning include classification (predicting discrete labels) and regression (predicting continuous values).
        Examples include spam email detection, image classification, and predicting house prices.
        Supervised learning algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, and linear regression.

    Unsupervised Learning:
        In unsupervised learning, the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, where there are no predefined output labels associated with the input data.
        The objective is to discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without explicit guidance.
        The algorithm explores the data to find hidden structures or groupings, often by clustering similar data points together.
        Common tasks in unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
        Examples include customer segmentation, document clustering, and outlier detection.
        Unsupervised learning algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and autoencoders.

5)DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF INDENTATION IN PYTHON CODE.
ANS:Indentation plays a crucial role in Python code because it is used to define the structure and organization of the code blocks. In Python, indentation is not just a matter of style or readability; it is part of the language syntax and affects how the code is interpreted. Here's why indentation is important in Python:

    Defining Code Blocks: In Python, indentation is used to denote code blocks such as function definitions, loop bodies, conditional statements, and class definitions. Code blocks are delineated by consistent indentation levels rather than explicit braces or keywords. This makes the code structure visually clear and helps maintain consistency across the codebase.

    Maintaining Readability: Proper indentation enhances the readability of Python code by visually indicating the hierarchical structure of the code. Developers can easily understand the relationships between different parts of the code, which improves code comprehension and maintainability, especially in larger projects or when collaborating with others.

    Enforcing Code Consistency: Python's strict indentation rules encourage consistent coding practices within a project or organization. Since Python code must adhere to a specific indentation style to be syntactically valid, developers are more likely to follow a consistent coding style, which leads to cleaner and more maintainable codebases.

    Detecting Syntax Errors: Incorrect indentation can result in syntax errors or unintended behavior in Python code. Python's interpreter relies on indentation to determine the structure of the code, so inconsistent or missing indentation can lead to errors such as "IndentationError" or logical errors in the program. Proper indentation helps identify and prevent such issues early in the development process.

6)DEFINE A VARIABLE IN PYTHON .PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF VALID VARIABLE NAMES.
ANS; In Python, a variable is a symbolic name that represents a value stored in the computer's memory. Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated and accessed throughout a program. To define a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to a name using the assignment operator "=".
   SYNTAX:
          VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE
    EXAMPLE:AGE=25
            NAME="SMART BRIDGE"
            SALARY=20000.00


7)EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A KEYWORD AND IDENTIFIER IN PYTHON.
ANS:     Keywords:
        Keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings and functionalities in Python.
        These words are part of the language syntax and are used to define the structure and logic of Python programs.
        Keywords cannot be used as variable names or identifiers because they are reserved for specific purposes within the language.
        Examples of Python keywords include if, else, for, while, def, class, import, True, False, None, etc.
        Using keywords as identifiers will result in syntax errors because Python interprets them as part of the language syntax rather than variable names.

    Identifiers:
        Identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, or any other user-defined entities in Python.
        Unlike keywords, identifiers are not predefined by the language and can be chosen by the programmer to represent various elements in their code.
        Identifiers must adhere to certain rules and conventions:
            They can contain letters (both lowercase and uppercase), digits, and underscores (_).
            They cannot start with a digit.
            They are case-sensitive, meaning age, Age, and AGE are considered different identifiers.
            It's recommended to use descriptive and meaningful names for identifiers to improve code readability and maintainability.
        Examples of identifiers in Python include variable names (age, name, is_student), function names (calculate_area, print_info), class names (Person, Car), module names, etc.
        Identifiers are user-defined and can represent any concept or entity within a Python program, allowing developers to create expressive and understandable code.

8)LIST THE BASIC DATA TYPES AVAILABLE IN PYTHON.
ANS: In Python, there are several basic data types used to represent different kinds of values. Here are the most common ones:

    Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without any decimal point. Examples: 5, -10, 1000.

    Float (float): Represents floating-point numbers, which include both integer and fractional parts. Examples: 3.14, -0.001, 2.0.

    Boolean (bool): Represents the truth values True and False, used for logical operations and comparisons. Example: True.

    String (str): Represents a sequence of characters enclosed within single (''), double ("") or triple (''' or """) quotes. Examples: 'hello', "world", '''multi-line string'''.

    List (list): Represents an ordered collection of items, which can be of different data types. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed. Example: [1, 2, 3, 4], ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'].

    Tuple (tuple): Similar to lists, but tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are defined using parentheses (). Example: (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c').

    Dictionary (dict): Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. Dictionaries are mutable and unordered. Example: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}.

    Set (set): Represents an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets do not allow duplicate values. Example: {1, 2, 3, 4}, {'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}.

9)DESCRIBE THE SYNTAX FOR AN IF STATEMENT IN PYTHON.
ANS:if condition:
    # Indented block of code to execute if the condition is True
    statement1
    statement2
    ...

10)EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF ELIF STATEMENT IN PYTHON.
ANS:In Python, the elif (short for "else if") statement is used in conjunction with the if statement to check multiple conditions sequentially. The elif statement allows you to specify additional conditions to be evaluated if the preceding if statement's condition is False. It serves as an alternative to using nested if statements or multiple independent if statements.

The purpose of the elif statement is to provide a way to handle multiple mutually exclusive conditions in a more organized and concise manner. It allows the program to evaluate multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on which condition evaluates to True. This is particularly useful when there are multiple possible scenarios or cases that need to be considered in a program.
   SYNTAX:
       if condition1:
    # Code block to execute if condition1 is True
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
elif condition2:
    # Code block to execute if condition2 is True
    statement3
    statement4
    ...
elif condition3:
    # Code block to execute if condition3 is True
    statement5
    statement6
    ...
else:
    # Code block to execute if none of the above conditions are True
    statement7
    statement8
